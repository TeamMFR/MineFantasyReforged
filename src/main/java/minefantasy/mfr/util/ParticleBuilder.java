/**
 * <i>"Don't waste time spawning particles manually - let {@code ParticleBuilder} do the work for you!"</i>
 * <p></p>
 * Singleton class that builds wizardry particles. This is an alternative (and neater, I think) solution to vanilla's
 * varargs-based system. All building methods are chainable, so particles can be created using only one line of code,
 * similar to how {@code BufferBuilder} is used for drawing vertices. This class replaces the particle spawning methods
 * in wizardry's proxies.
 * <p></p>
 * {@link ParticleBuilder#instance} retrieves the static instance of the particle builder. Use
 * {@link ParticleBuilder#particle(ResourceLocation)} to start building a particle, or alternatively use the static
 * convenience version {@link ParticleBuilder#create(ResourceLocation)}. Use {@link ParticleBuilder#spawn(World)}
 * to finish building and spawn the particle. Between these two, a variety of parameters can be set using the various
 * setter methods (see individual method descriptions for more details). These, along with {@code ParticleBuilder.particle(...)},
 * return the particle builder instance, allowing them to be chained together to spawn particles using a single line of code.
 * If any parameters are unspecified these will default to certain values, which may or may not depend on the particle type.
 * Not all parameters affect all particles. Again, see individual method descriptions for more details.
 * <p></p>
 * For example, a typical call to the particle builder might look something like this:
 * <p></p>
 * <code>ParticleBuilder.create(Type.SPARKLE).pos(x, y, z).vel(vx, vy, vz).clr(r, g, b).spawn(world);</code>
 * <p></p>
 * It also goes without saying that <b>this class should only ever be used client-side</b>. Attempting to spawn particles
 * on the server side will not work and will print a warning to the console. {@code ParticleBuilder} is not threadsafe
 * and attempting to call it from multiple threads at once will very likely cause an {@link IllegalStateException}.

// The number of different combinations of parameters now required for the various particle
// types in wizardry made the method overloads in the proxies very cumbersome and inevitably resulted in redundant
// parameters, which made the code messy and hard to read. Those methods have now been removed.

// Strictly speaking, this isn't a builder class in the traditional sense, because rather than returning the built
// object at the end, it sends it to be processed instead and returns nothing. Additionally, unlike most builders
// it's a singleton, because it's likely to be called very frequently and since this only happens from a single (client)
// thread, there's no point making a new instance every time and clogging the heap with objects. It's also lazy, see
// the comment about builder variables below.
